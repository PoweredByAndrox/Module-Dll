# Module-Dll
 Just Test Module System Dlls For Engine
 
 Example: We have exe file of main Engine programm and some Dlls "module" of some system (e.g. Multiplayer or Render)\
 And you want to update them for new versions without updating main exe\
 This is also will work for "backward-compatibility" code. See the Test_Dlls.sln for more information how it works
